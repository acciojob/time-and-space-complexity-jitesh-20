	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity is a measure used to estimate the efficiency of an algorithm, indicating how the computational time required grows with the size of the input data. 
		Efficient algorithms are those that solve problems with lower time complexity, ensuring they perform well even as input sizes increase.
		For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of 𝑂(𝑛log𝑛). O(nlogn) is generally more efficient than one with 𝑂(𝑛2). O(n2) for large inputs. 
		Understanding time complexity helps developers choose and design solutions that balance performance with resource constraints.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute, including both the input size and any additional space used during computation.
		It is crucial for understanding how efficiently an algorithm uses memory resources. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of \(O(n)\) means the memory usage grows linearly with the size of the input, which can be efficient for moderate-sized inputs but may become challenging for larger data sets. 
		Analyzing <b>Space complexity</b> helps in optimizing memory usage and preventing resource exhaustion.
