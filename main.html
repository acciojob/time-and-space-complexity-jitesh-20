	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity is a measure used to estimate the efficiency of an algorithm, indicating how the computational time required grows with the size of the input data, efficient algorithms are those that solve problems with lower time complexity, ensuring they perform well even as input sizes increase.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute, an algorithm with a <b>Space Complexity</b> of O(n) means the memory usage grows linearly with the size of the input.
